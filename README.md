# Monkey Island Wheel

A special take on Play'n GOs Money Wheel, themed using (The Secret of ) Monkey Island graphics. A splash screen requiring the user to enter the required balance/coins, and a game scene that allows the user to bet on various bet areas and spin the wheel to try out his luck.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Prior installation of Node (for NPM)

### Installing & Running

1. Go to root folder (`cd slot-game`)
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Default browser tab should load automatically, however project should be running at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Potential Improvements
- Improve responsiveness (particularly on mobile devices)
- Add testing (unit, end-to-end, visual regression, 
etc...)
- Include Dependency Injection (may be better off with inclusion of UI framework e.g. React)
- Update proper CONFIG usage (standardise approach and use more `.model.ts` files)

## Notes

1. All requested functionality has been implemented.
2. Additionally implemented sound effects (including mute/unmute).
